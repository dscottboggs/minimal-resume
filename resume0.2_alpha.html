<div id="panel2">While professionally I am very qualified as a transportation professional, my real passion is to creatively solve problems, especially through technology. I don't have a lot of official qualifications in that regard, but I do study any material available to me constantly and I'm always adding to the list below.

<div id="flip3">Audio</div>
<div id="panel3">
	I've been studying music theory through instruments for over a decade,
	but to be honest I became bored with simply playing music years ago.
	I got into electronic music a few years ago, and I love raw composition,
	and sound design. I have been producing music and experimenting with
	sound for 5 years now and would be quite capable of any sort of
	waveform manipulation or sound design/production situation.
</div>
<div id="flip4">Photography and Video</div>
<div id="panel4">
	I have been working with digital photography and videography quite
	steadily for the past year or so, and it's been a passing interest
	most of my life. There were a lot of broken cameras when I was younger
	so there was a lot of time that I held an interest and studied it,
	but didn't have the equipment to experiment with it, until more recently.
	I also have studied framing and composition throughout my life
	including times when I did not have a camera.
	<br><br>
	I am currently preparing to film a feature-length movie. You can find out more
	at <a href="http://ehl.papertheater.co">ehl.papertheater.co</a>
