  This page is here to concisely demonstrate the ways in which I can be
  valuable to potential clienteÌ€le, who may be interested in my services
  for long- and short-term contract opportunities. As you may notice, I
  have diversified my skill-set, so that I can approach problems from a
  unique perspective. I will often see an angle to a problem that others
  don't see because of my wide field of study. However, because of that,
  I may have skills that are not relevant to your needs, so I've organized
  by general category to help you to quickly find the skills most relevant
  to you. Simply click the category you find most relevant to expand it.
  If you have any questions, or to set up an interview, I can be reached
  at the above contact information.

      My largest range of official experience is in the transportation industry.
      I have around three years of professional experience. I prefer to drive a manual
      transmission vehicle, do my own maintenance, and am comfortable behind the wheel
      of large vehicles as well as small.<br />

          <li>I began my study of the inner workings of electronics on my own when I was
              younger, but at 14 a local TV repairman agreed to teach me, and I spent a
              year and a half learning how electricity and circuits work and learning to
              troubleshoot hardware under his guidance.</li>
          <li>I also have worked for a few computer repair shops over the years. Most
            are now defunct and as such providing contact information would be difficult</li>

                time since I've used Office proper, as I use LibreOffice for my

      I have been working with digital photography and videography quite
      steadily for the past several years, and it's been a passing interest
      most of my life. There were a lot of broken cameras when I was younger
      so there was a lot of time that I held an interest and studied it,
      but didn't have the equipment to experiment with it, until more recently.
      I also have studied framing and composition throughout my life
      including times when I did not have a camera.
