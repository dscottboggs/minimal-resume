  This page is here to concisely demonstrate the ways in which I can be
  valuable to potential clientèle, who may be interested in my services
  for long- and short-term contract opportunities. As you may notice, I
  have diversified my skill-set, so that I can approach problems from a
  unique perspective. I will often see an angle to a problem that others
  don't see because of my wide field of study.
  <br />
  However, because of that,
  I may have skills that are not relevant to your needs, so I've organized
  by general category to help you to quickly find the skills most relevant
  to you. Simply click the category you find most relevant to expand it.
  If you have any questions, or to set up an interview, I can be reached
  at the above contact information.

    I am highly proficient in the full Linux deployment stack, from server to
    desktop and back to web. My primary home desktop/server machine is running
    Ubuntu 18.04 server with i3 desktop. Linux administration is definitely my
    strongest skill, and in front of this machine is where I spend most of my
    time.

        I study programming with great interest on a daily basis, usually for
        several hours a day. These are some languages and frameworks I consider
        myself proficient in:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/dscottboggs?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=go">
              Go</a> -- Web APIs and CLI using standard library. I have a couple
              negroni/gorilla middlware modules that are under development as
              well.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/dscottboggs?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=crystal">
              Crystal</a> -- I've never seen Crystal code I couldn't understand
              just by reading. My language of choice for personal projects</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/dscottboggs?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=python">
              Python</a> -- Web APIs using Flask, some web scraping using
              BeautifulSoup4, general scripting that involves math or complex
              input cases that bash/sh isn't as good at handling</li>
          <li>Javascript -- JQuery (this site); ReactJS; nodeJS</li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://github.com/dscottboggs?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=shell">
              sh/bash
            </a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        Languages I am familiar with and could become just as proficient in with
        some time to train:
        <ul>
          <li>ruby</li>
          <li>PyQt</li>
          <li>Kotlin</li>
          <li>Java</li>
        </ul>
        My current choice development stacks are Go or Crystal for CLI or
        library programming (depending on library availability), and for HTTP
        APIs, ReactJS for web UIs, and PyQt for desktop. I would choose
        OpenStack or GitLab continuous integration with Kubernetes for a
        scalable deployment. I also have been eyeing GTK/F#, TornadoFX, and
        Vue.js, but there's only so much time in a day. I'm looking forward to
        development progressing on Fission.io and qt5.cr.
        <br/> <br/>
        I find API development most compelling right now. There are tools that I
        feel that should exist -- like access to high-level, statically-compiled
        lanugaes and frameworks like Go, or Crystal. Like a WebAssembly-compiled
        SPA/PWA framework. Like a decent desktop GUI framework. The more
        accessible these high-level frameworks become, the higher quality our
        software will be in general.

          	My experience also extends to manual and automated deployments of
            Linux in various environments, be it desktop, server, or otherwise.
            I maintain a number of web services for personal use, including the
            interactive version of this resume page, all of which I host with
            open-source solutions on Linux. I’ve even experimented with
            creating full-deployment automation scripts. Currently I use
            docker-compose on a single Linux server, which is adequate for my
            needs, but I’m familiar with many other virtualization,
            containerization, and deployment concepts. Security awareness is
            always a high priority when dealing with online interactions,
            and all my sites get A+ ratings from SSLLabs.

        My interest in and experience with technology goes back all the way
        into my childhood. I’ve always liked to take it all apart and see how
        it works. I started learning how HTML and the web works at 10, wrote my
        first programs in the library before school in 7th grade. I had an
        under-the-table job at 14 fixing TVs and VCRs, and I’ve never stopped
        studying. I have some knowledge of SQL and database management, as well
        as working knowledge of version-control systems and continuous
        integration/automated deployment solutions.

    My largest range of official experience is in the transportation industry.
    I have around three years of professional experience. I prefer to drive a
    manual transmission vehicle, do my own maintenance, and am comfortable
    behind the wheel of large vehicles as well as small.<br />

      I have been working with digital photography and videography quite
      steadily for the past several years, and it's been a passing interest
      most of my life. There were a lot of broken cameras when I was younger
      so there was a lot of time that I held an interest and studied it,
      but didn't have the equipment to experiment with it, until more recently.
      I also have studied framing and composition throughout my life
      including times when I did not have a camera.

      I have been contracted for some small photography contracts, and enjoy
      and understand that work. I can do my own lighting, and editing as well
      as film video. I have a thorough understanding of lighting, framing, and
      the general concepts used to create aesthetic photographs. I don’t pursue
      this actively as a career but am able and willing to offer photography
      services.
